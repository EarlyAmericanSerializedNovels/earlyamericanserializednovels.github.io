    <p>The <em>New York Magazine, or Literary Repository</em> (1790-1797) was one of
the longest running American magazines of the 1700s and is commonly
studied because of its status as a particularly influential periodical
of the early republic. It was in print for 8 years and had almost 100
issues. It published accounts of theater performances and travel as well
as current events and extracts of essays and creative works. The
publisher was T. and J. Swords of New York, who published two other
Christian journals around the same time and printed bound books as well.
Thomas and James Swords, the printers and editors, were fairly
well-known journalists. They drew on the work of the Friendly Club in
many of this publication’s issues. The <em>New York Magazine</em>’s overall
contents are eclectic and seem to claim a curatorship of the interests
of the intellectual elite. However, the subscription list reveals a
varied readership, about half of which were artisans and shopkeepers,
though public figures like George Washington and John Adams are also
included. The political leanings of the magazine may help explain the
appeal to this specific readership.</p>

<p><em>The History of Maria Kittle</em> was first serialized in the <em>New York
Magazine</em> from September 1790 to January 1791, with each update
appearing monthly for a total of five installments. The magazine also
published some of Bleecker’s other work, especially poetry; however,
each piece was submitted by Bleecker’s daughter Margaretta V. Faugeres
several years after her mother’s death. The magazine publishers, T. and
J. Swords of New York, went on to publish the <em>Posthumous Works of Ann
Eliza Bleecker, in Prose and Verse</em> in bound form in 1793, which
included <em>The History of Maria Kittle,</em> another unfinished historical
novel called <em>The History of Henry and Ann</em>, a collection of poetry and
letters, and some of Margaretta’s own literary work. Because of its
immense popularity, <em>The History of Maria Kittle</em> was finally
republished separately in its own volume in 1797 by Elisha Babcock of
Hartford, Connecticut. There is very little difference between the text
published in the magazine and stand-alone novel versions of the tale,
beyond minor editorial revisions. Interestingly, a 19^th^ century New
York women’s magazine called <em>The Ladies’ Literary Cabinet, Being a
Repository of Miscellaneous Literary Productions, both Original and
Selected in Prose and Verse</em> (1819-1822) republished the novel in serial
form beginning in 1821. It was common practice to republish work this
way, and <em>The History of Maria Kittle</em> may have appeared in other
periodicals as well.</p>

<p><em>The History of Maria Kittle</em> is often described as the first captivity
novel, because it utilizes the captivity narrative form without a solid
basis on the actual experience of the author or the record of an
amanuensis. This is ironic given the opening lines of the novel. There
are claims that the novel is based on the actual experiences of Maria
Kittle or Kittlehyun, whose family lived in the same region as the
Bleeckers, and whose captivity narrative can be corroborated by an
account with similar detail in another memoir. However, the text of the
novel emphasizes several other themes independent of historical
fidelity, leaving room for a more creative retelling. One of its major
themes, conflict between native and colonial Americans, had major impact
on the way other writers dealt with the issue. For example, Bleecker may
have influenced Cooper’s approach to Native Americans in <em>The Last of
the Mohicans</em>.</p>

<p>Bleecker’s novel adopts many of the literary tropes of her time,
including the captivity narrative, epistolary structure, reliance on the
power of sentiment, religious didacticism, elegiac verse, and the
domestic manifestation of national politics. The plot reflects Maria
Kittle’s capture by Native Americans at the time of the French and
Indian War, the loss of most her family including her two young children
to the violence of her abductors, their flight to Montreal where she is
revived by a circle of sympathetic English and French women, and her
eventual miraculous reunion with her husband. The treatment of the
Native American characters is very stereotypical. She depicts them as
untrustworthy, brutal savages who murder women and children. However,
the combination of Maria Kittle’s account and Bleecker’s own life
experience during the Revolutionary War leads to an overall meditation
on loss in the novel, especially feminine, maternal loss, and the
comfort of female fellowship. The displacement of the conflict Bleecker
herself experienced onto Maria Kittle’s situation among her Indian
neighbors leads to the foregrounding of women’s issues in the politics
of early America and white women’s role in nation building. Her story
examines the emotional trauma of collateral damage, especially as a
woman effected by the conflicts of early America.</p>

<p>Though few scholars have analyzed Bleecker’s work at length, and those
who have focus mainly on her pastoral poetry or the historical
significance of her work and its politics, especially her treatment of
Native Americans, very few if any critics have discussed the
significance of the novel’s original and continued serialization. This
leaves several intriguing questions unanswered. For example: What made
this tale such a good fit for this magazine and its readership? Also,
further research should be done on the way each installment can be read
in isolation from the others, in context of the other work published in
the magazine, and in relation to the layers of time it represents from
its authorship in 1779 to its depiction of pre-revolution events and
relevance to the conditions of the time of publication and
republication. The novel is depicted here as it appeared in the <em>New
York Magazine</em>, its first publication, in order to foster further
answers to these questions.</p>

<p>As stated earlier, Bleecker’s biography is a significant aspect of most
interpretations of her novel. She was born Anna Elizabeth Schuyler
around October 1752 as the sixth child of Margareta Van Wyck and Brandt
Schuyler, prosperous Dutch merchants and aristocrats of New York City.
Her father Brandt Schuyler died shortly before she was born, and her
mother married Anthony Ten Eyck in 1760. Their daughter Susanna is the
addressee of Ann’s epistolary captivity novel <em>The History of Maria
Kittle.</em> Ann married into another prominent Dutch family in 1769,
becoming the wife of lawyer John James Bleecker, who encouraged her
writing. They moved to Tomhanick, a more agricultural region near
Albany, in 1771, which inspired much of Ann’s pastoral poetry. The
Bleeckers had two daughters. The eldest, Margaretta, also became a
writer and was responsible for publishing most of her mother’s work. The
younger daughter Abella died of dysentery in 1777 during the
Revolutionary War when the family was forced to flee their home in
Tomhanick because the British General Burgoyne’s troops were invading
the area from the North. Ann saw her mother die during the flight
southward, and then her sister Caty Swits died on the return journey.
Ann, her daughter Margaretta, and a mullato girl survived. John Bleecker
was absent for the entire episode, fighting for the militia in support
of the revolution.</p>

<p>At home again in 1779, Ann produced a periodical called the “Albany
Gazette” filled with her own essays and poetry for her family and
friends to read. This highlights the significance of the periodical
genre to early Americans and to Bleecker specifically. However, much of
her writing after so much personal loss, including the novel transcribed
here, dealt with grief. Unfortunately, Ann’s husband, who continued in
the militia, was captured in 1781, and Ann suffered a miscarriage and
mental breakdown in shock. Her husband was rescued quickly, but she
never completely regained her spirits and died November 23, 1783.</p>

<p>In <em>The History of Maria Kittle,</em> Bleecker deals specifically with
mothers mourning the loss of their children and other family members in
times of violence. However, by using the structure of a captivity
narrative and the setting of the French and Indian War, the novel
explores this theme while vilifying Native Americans rather than the
British. This trend of scapegoating and demonizing Native Americans
continued into the 19^th^ century. Although, Bleecker herself did not
live to see much peace in the newly formed United States, her words
survived to comfort, entertain and challenge other citizens of the new
nation. Though her novel and other work enjoyed enormous popularity in
the early republic, it went out of fashion until more recent scholars
went looking for alternative perspectives of American history and early
examples of the American novel.</p>
