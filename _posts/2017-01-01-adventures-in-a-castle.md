### Preface

*Adventures in a Castle* was published initially in eight serialized
installments in the Philadelphia Repository and Weekly Register (PRWR).
The first of the work’s eight installments was printed on May 2^nd^,
1801 and its publication continued weekly through June 30^th^ of that
same year. The editor, David Hogan, was responsible for the
serialization and inclusion of *Adventures in a Castle* in the PRWR
magazine. The vast extent of what is known about the author is shared in
the paratext Hogan includes in its serialized publication. Hogan
references the author Julius intermittently (a total of seven times)
throughout the fictional narrative. Typically these references are just
by name and appear at the conclusion of an installment. However, at the
end of the story, Hogan divulges some interesting views and revealing
contextualized interpretation of the tale in the concluding paratext.

In addition to his gratitude for the author Julius’ timely submissions,
Hogan admits in the final paratextual reference that “the literary world
abounds with the trifles of this kind.” Hogan goes on to suggest that
consequently “no doubt \[works like this one\], in some measure, forms a
criterion by which to judge of the taste of the age; tho’ a taste of
this kind of reading, is not, perhaps, peculiar to the present one.”
Essentially, what Hogan concedes is that while this tale is not
extraordinary in and of itself, it does delineate the general
expectation readers of that age upheld.

Tales like *Adventures in a Castle*, as Hogan suggests “inculcates a
moral, if not new, yet good.” In this story, Hogan maintains the Count
de Vauban (avarice personified) “meets with the deserved punishment:
while the innocent objects of his horrid persecution, are extricated
from his cruel fangs, and finally brought to the enjoyment of more
perfect domestic felicity, than they would otherwise probably have
attained, had it not been for those very circumstances to which his
machinations gave birth.” This particular outcome not only conforms to
reader expectation but it does so because it corroborates an espoused or
at least perceived divine truth of the period that “the wicked are often
snared in their own devices.” Hogan concludes the paratext with his
praise of Julius’ prose and his ability to refrain from “those
passionate exclamations, that often insinuate a degree of profanity into
the mind, and with which tales and novels frequently abound.” He
insinuates to the reader that any new works Julius may choose to submit
will be given the utmost consideration from the editor.

Julius is credited with a few additional serialized works and literary
appearances that emerged at different times in the Philadelphia
Repository and Weekly Register. In a letter to the editor, on October
17^th^ 1801, Julius bemoans the behavior of two primary correspondents
over the issue of Mr. Law and the Uranian Society. In the April 2^nd^
1803 publication Julius addresses the periodical’s editor David Hogan
through paratext interjected before the poem “Epitaph” urging his
readership to help solve an apparent chronological inconsistency in the
work. In one of the earliest submissions on April 4^th^ 1801, Julius, in
the short fictional work “Curious Incident,” patterns much of what he
accomplishes later in *Adventures in a Castle* through his construction
of this demonstrable moralistic tale. The final reference of Julius in
PRWR is the serialized work entitled *The Ruins*. *The Ruins* was a
similarly moralistic tale that was serialized into six installments
beginning on the 28^th^ of November 1801 publication in and finishing on
the January 16^th^ edition in 1802.

As its name suggests, the Philadelphia Repository and Weekly Register
(PRWR) was printed in the early 19^th^ Century in Philadelphia
Pennsylvania. The publication was printed in quarto form. A “quarto” is
a book or pamphlet composed of one or more sheets of paper on which
eight pages are printed, which are then folded twice over to create four
“leaves.” During its five-and-a-half-year existence from November 15^th^
1800 to April 5^th^ 1806, the PRWR was edited by David Hogan, John W.
Scott, and ultimately Thomas Irwin.

This eight-page weekly publication included an assortment of
miscellaneous subjects, matters, and content that were composed in a
diverse range of forms including: original essays, serialized tales,
extracts from both new and older publications, biographical sketches,
and some material on the theater. According to the *History of
Philadelphia* Volume III, the Philadelphia Repository and Weekly
Register was popular with many because it was “edited with a kind spirit
of encouragement towards their experiments in writing, and offered a
place for their poetry, tales, and sketches, upon terms of criticism not
very strict or severe. Interestingly, the majority of issues often
included musical compositions, and during the period of time when Hogan
and Scott oversaw the periodical’s publication, which essentially
constituted the first four volumes, the final page was dedicated almost
exclusively to poetry.

Each of the narrative’s serialized excerpts are contained in the
periodical’s first volume–in consecutive issues twenty-five through
thirty-two. The original aggregation and organization of the serialized
content, which was used as the primary source material for the
transcription was retrieved from the American Periodicals Series II
Database.

*Adventures in a Castle* was also reprinted and featured in the New-York
Weekly Museum (NYWM). It appeared in six installments beginning on
January 2^nd^ and ending on the 6^th^ February 1808. It is interesting
to consider just how much the readability of the text is impacted by the
two different serializations (and even much later novelized edition).

*Adventures in a Castle*, in its initial eight-installment-serialization
were shorter, so out of necessity, the “new” breaks in the two
serialized publications must necessarily be evaluated to determine
impact. There is no question that the flow of the narrative is changed
by the alterations of the second serialized publication, but not knowing
exactly who the author is nor if they had completed the entirety of the
work prior to its first serialization with a specifically intended form
for publication invites a great deal of supposition that is difficult to
definitively conclude. Audience, and the organization and publication of
the magazine also play a key factors in evaluating the serial’s
readability. Changes between serializations are not just limited to
form, even the title changed with the second serial. The work was no
longer entitled merely *Adventures in a Castle* but another optional
title was inserted—*The Two Brothers*.

The NYWM was a four-page magazine intended largely for female
readerships. It was characterized as a “polite repository of amusement
and instruction; being an assemblage of whatever can interest the mind,
or exalt the character of the American fair.” Much of the content was of
a sentimental and moral nature and included fictional romances that were
frequently serialized. Additionally, the magazine included other various
written forms like poetry, anecdotes, a morality column, theatrical
reviews, domestic and foreign news, as well as advertisements. The
publication run of NYWM spanned over a decade from 1805-1817.

Adventures in a Castle.  
  
An Original Story.  
  
PREVIOUS to the revolution which  
has convulsed Europe, and before peace  
and order were banished from the bosom  
of France, lived Monsieur Boileau. His  
chateau was situated on the border of a  
small stream which glided through a roman-  
tic valley in the province of Burgundy.  
He had formerly resided in the capital, and  
had ever borne an unblemished character;  
but having the misfortune of being bereft  
of the partner of his felicity, he purchased  
this small spot, to which he retired, accom-  
panied by his two sons, Louis and Henry,  
neither of them of an age capable of feel-  
ing the severity of their loss: Louis the eld-  
est being but thirteen, and his brother two  
years younger. Monsieur Boileau here  
employed the principle part of his time in  
instructing his two children in every branch  
of science, and with pleasure observed the  
progress they made in their studies, and  
the justice of their observations on the va-  
rious authors, whose works he had sub-  
mitted to their perusal. Several years had  
passed away, and the two brothers had  
nearly attained the age of maturity, when  
the hand of death deprived them of their  
father: sincere was their grief on this oc-  
casion, for they had always loved him with  
the fondest affection. On his death-bed  
he committed them to the care of his friend  
Monsieur Dupont, then an inhabitant of  
Dijon, the capital of the province, who  
received the weeping orphans with tender-  
ness, sympathized with their sorrows, and  
soothed their afflictions, by his kind atten-  
tion. It may not be amiss here to observe,  
that Monsieur Boileau was a descendant of  
a noble house, and that if he had survived  
his brother the Count de Vauban, he would  
have inherited his title, therefore Louis  
his eldest son, became the heir apparent  
of his uncle: between the Count and his  
brother a difference had long subsisted, and  
which was not terminated by the death of  
the latter, but the enmity was continu-  
ed to his innocent nephews; though as  
his brother had left a very considerable for-  
tune, and his own was too small to support  
his extravagance, he pretended to entertain  
a great affection for them, that he might  
have an opportunity of executing his vil-  
lainous designs. Monsieur Dupont, whom  
his friend Boileau, appointed guardian of  
his children, was a gentleman who had too  
great an acquaintance with the world and  
its arts, to suffer himself to be deceived by  
a specious appearance, he therefore min-  
utely noticed the Count's conduct, and act-  
ed with caution in any thing with which  
he was concerned. Shortly after the young  
Boileau's were numbered amongst the  
family, Dupont removed to his country  
seat: it was a large house, and it appeared  
as if it had stood for centuries, by the ru-  
inous condition of many parts of it. It had  
been bequeathed to him by a distant rela-  
tion in its present state; by admiring the  
grandeur of its situation, and the beautiful  
scenery which surrounded it, he had resolv-  
ed to spare no expense in making it suita-  
ble to receive his family, during the sum-  
mer months. He had therefore repaired  
the north wing of the building, and deter-  
mined to refit the whole in the ensuing year.  
This spot they made their retreat, and. were  
frequently visited by the Count de Vauban,  
who would often spend whole weeks with  
them.  
But this seeming friendship for his  
nephews did not lull the watchfulness of  
Mr. Dupont, and frequently while tracing  
the various avenues to the southern wing  
of the house, he would perceive himself  
carefully followed, by the scrutinizing  
eye of the faithful guardian. Although he  
was sensible that he was the object of the  
suspicion of Monsieur Dupont, yet it did  
not deter him from contriving further plans  
to deprive his nephews of their estate. One  
night Henry, the youngest, complained of  
a slight indisposition, and retired unusually  
early to bed; at breakfast hour the next  
morning he had not appeared, which his  
guardian attributed to his not having rested  
well the preceding night, owing to his trif-  
ling illness, but when the dinner-bell rung,  
and he had not been seen, he became se-  
riously alarmed for his safety, and instant-  
ly attended by Louis, entered his chamber,  
when to their astonishment, he was not  
to be found. To conjecture where he was,  
orby what unaccountable manner he had  
disappeared, was almost impossible, but  
all the supposition that could be entertain-  
ed by Mr. Dupont was, that it had been  
effected by foul means, and the suspicion  
of the deed rested on the Count, who had  
departed early on the morning. Thus did  
they remain, when the idea presented it-  
self to the mind of Mr. Dupont that pro-  
bably some of the servants had been pre-  
vailed upon by the Count to poison their  
food, and that though himself and Louis  
had escaped, yet Henry might have fallen  
a victim to the plot, and had been removed  
in the night.

(Continued.)  
  
THE moment he suggested the thought,  
he ordered all the servants to be assembled  
in the hall, but all firmly protesting, that  
they were innocent, and no proofs of guilt  
appearing, they were discharged. What  
confirms this unanimous declaration, and  
contradicted his former opinion, was the  
door being locked within, and the height  
of the chamber from the ground so great,  
that it appeared to be impossible to ap-  
proach it from without. Another circum-  
stance happened soon after this unaccount-  
able disappearance, which filled the breast  
of Monsieur Dupont with alarm, and tend-  
ed to strengthen the suspicion he had en-  
tertained of the Count’s being concerned  
in the transaction. Louis returning one  
evening from Dijon, meditating on the  
strange accident which had so deeply af-  
flicted him, rode on before his attendants:  
but he had not proceeded far, when he was  
assaulted by six armed ruffians. He de-  
fended himself with such dexterity and  
resolution, that when his servants came  
to his assistance they found one of the vil-  
lains lifeless at his feet, the others having  
fled at their approach. The wounds he  
received in this encounter confined him to  
the house for several weeks: and when he  
was restored to health Monsieur Dupont,  
sensible that the safety of the son of his  
deceased friend depended on his removal  
to another part of the kingdom, private-  
ly departed for the chateau of Monsieur  
Boileau. The family of Dupont, which  
consisted of himself, his wife and daugh-  
ter, willingly relinquished the pleasures of  
society in favour of Louis, for his engaging  
behaviour had so won their regard, that  
there was no gratification which they  
would not yield when put in competition  
with his safety. His pleasures were here  
embittered by the recollection of many  
painful scenes, and his imagination paint-  
ed in lively colours the happiness he had  
once enjoyed on this spot, in the society  
of his father and brother.  
  
Not far distant from their present resi-  
dence stood an old castle, the seat of Mon-  
sieur Boileau’s ancestors, now in the pos-  
session of the Count de Vauban; this place  
young Louis had frequently wished to ex-  
amine when a child, but the dusky ap-  
pearance of the whole, had prevented the  
gratification of his curiosity. Monsieur  
Dupont beheld with concern the melancho-  
ly that had taken possession of the mind of  
his young ward, and in order to divert his  
attention, proposed that they should ex-  
plore together the recesses of the castle.  
To this Louis readily assented, and they  
set out early one morning for that purpose,  
unattended. They intended entering by  
the gateway, but their passage was ob-  
structed by the stones which had fallen  
from the battlements, and they were obli-  
ged to seek another entrance, which they  
soon found in a low door leading to the  
foot of a staircase: this they ascended, and  
found themselves in the apartments allotted  
to the servants. Through these they pas-  
sed into a large gallery, which still contained a  
number of beautiful pictures. Louis, who  
was extremely fond of painting, remained  
to take a narrower view of them, while  
Monsieur Dupont advanced farther in the  
castle. He had not proceeded far, before  
he heard the murmur of voices approaching  
in an opposite direction to the portrait  
gallery, where he had left Louis, and he  
immediately after perceived two men ap-  
parently engaged in a very interesting con-  
versation, but the subject of it remained  
unknown to him, as they descended a flight  
of steps at some distance before him. Sur-  
prised at their appearance, he hastily return-  
ed to Louis, and acquainted him with what  
he had seen, telling him they would come  
in the afternoon with a few servants armed,  
in order to penetrate the mystery, as the  
castle had always been considered as un-  
inhabited. To the chateau they accord-  
ingly went, and when they had dined,  
they loaded their pistols and set out, ac-  
companied by James, Louis's valet, and  
five others on whom they could depend.  
They passed into the castle by the same  
way as before, and entered a narrow  
winding passage, which seemed to extend  
along the whole of the building: following  
this they reached a spiral staircase, that  
they descended, and on the first floor below  
they perceived that they were at the junc-  
tion of the branches of a large entry. Here  
they hesitated, not knowing which to  
pursue, when they heard the sound of a  
distant footstep behind them. They instant-  
ly secreted themselves, and immediately  
perceived a man pass by without noticing  
them. He was soon met by another, and  
a dialogue ensued, which was not con-  
ducted on so low a key but that they were  
overheard. “Gerald,” said the first, who  
appeared to have some authority, "the  
prisoner’s fate is now determined, and he  
must be dispatched as expeditiously as  
possible.” “Why," replied the other,  
is this sudden resolution? I thought it was  
not to have been done.”  
  
"No matter," answered the first, "do  
you see it is done; I am in haste: when  
it is finished, prepare to the grand hall."  
Upon this they separated, and walked down  
different avenues. When they had got a  
considerable distance, it was resolved that  
Louis, his valet, and another servant, should  
follow the second, while Monsieur Dupont  
and the remainder should pursue the first.  
Louis and his small party proceeded after  
Gerald with great caution, till he entered  
a small chamber: They remained within  
sight of the door for nearly an hour, when  
finding he did not return, they ventured  
to look into the room, where they perceive-  
ed he had passed through an opposite  
door.  
  
Vexed at being thus disappointed, Louis  
rushed hastily forward, and had soon ad-  
vanced considerably before his companions,  
when he perceived the same man striking  
a light. As soon as he had succeeded, he  
proceeded till he reached a stair-case,  
when he began to descend. Louis, desirous  
of rescuing the unknown prisoner from the  
murderous designs of his enemies, contin-  
ued to follow the man, whom he now saw  
was armed, till at length he was assured  
by the dampness of the air and the dim  
glimmering of the light which Gerald car-  
ried in his hand, that he was in the vaults  
of the castle. JULIUS.

(Continued.)  
  
Undaunted by the certainty that he was  
at a great distance from his companions, he  
persisted in his resolute undertaking, and  
grasping a brace of pistols, with cautious  
steps pursued the assassin (who had by this  
time ceased to descend,) thro' the winding  
avenues of the subterranean apartments,  
when he suddenly fell through a trap door  
into the vault below. Here he remained  
a considerable time senseless from the  
fall; one of the pistols, which he had held in his  
hand was discharged, and the report rever-  
berating from the gloomy cavities, vibrated  
on the ear of the astonish'd Gerald with  
such an awful sound, that he remained  
almost lifeless with terror. When reason  
had resumed her functions over his mind,  
he removed himself as fast as his trembling  
limbs would bear him, from the spot which  
had inspired him with such dreadful appre-  
hensions, unable to comprehend from what  
cause they had arisen. While Gerald was  
proceeding to execute his diabolical pur-  
pose, far other sensations pervaded the  
breast of Louis: providentially he had not  
received any material injury, and when he  
had recovered from the swoon into which  
his fall had thrown him, he arose disappoint-  
ed, because he now believed himself inca-  
pable of preventing the accomplishment of  
Gerald's murderous designs on the un-  
known victim. Picturing to himself some  
unfortunate man fallen into the hands of  
his enemies, and suffering under the dagger  
of the nightly assassin, he paced with has-  
ty steps, the cavern into which he had  
been thrown, when a deep groan assail'd  
his ear. His first sensation was an invol-  
untary emotion of fear, but listening for  
some minutes attentively, and not hearing  
it repeated, he attributed it to his perturb-  
ed imagination.  
  
After some minutes had elapsed it was  
repeated, and he heard it too distinctly to  
suffer him to consider it as the wanderings  
of his own disordered fancy. Advancing  
towards the place from whence the sound  
proceeded, he perceived the reflection of a  
light proceeding from an iron grate, and  
which upon a nearer view he found was  
placed upon a small table in the adjoining  
vault. Near it was a man in chains, ly-  
ing on a miserable bed of straw, from whom  
the groans which had alarmed him issued.  
He had scarcely reached the grate when  
an opposite door opened, and Gerald, the  
same whom he had followed so long, enter-  
ed the vault. Louis had one pistol charg-  
ed, and that he determined to use in the  
preservation of the helpless sufferer, and  
as the assassin was preparing to execute his  
infamous purpose, he exclaimed,--"Infer-  
nal instrument of tyranny, go to that world  
where thy black soul shall suffer torments  
worthy of so foul a miscreant," and at the  
same moment Gerald received a ball in his  
breast from the hand of Louis. Roused by  
the noise from a broken slumber, the pri-  
soner raised himself from the floor, and pre-  
sented to the eye of the astonished Louis  
the ghastly countenance *of his brother Hen*-  
ry. Joy at once more beholding those be-  
loved features, inspired him strength, and  
grasping the bars with a nervous hand, he  
wrenched the whole out of its position, and  
in an instant he found himself in the arms  
of his brother. When the first emotions  
attendant on such an occasion had subsided,  
they resolved to return by the way Gerald  
had entered the dungeon. Louis there-  
fore searching the pockets of the deceased  
murderer, found the keys which fastened  
the chains round the body of Henry, and  
liberated him. Leaving the lamp upon  
the table, they quitted this gloomy dungeon,  
intending to direct their steps towards the  
mansions of the living without any light,  
rather than expose themselves to detection.  
Carefully moving along the vaults, they  
passed the trap door, through which Louis  
had descended, and ascended the staircase;  
as they were moving along the dark passa-  
ges at the top, they heard the report of a  
pistol at some distance, and in a few min-  
utes they were joined by M. Dupont, who  
placing his finger on his lips in token of si-  
lence, beckoned them to follow him, and  
proceeded with hasty steps in the di-  
rection towards the door by which they  
had entered the castle: but as they were  
descending the spiral staircase, they heard  
a hoarse voice at the bottom, calling to o-  
thers, and bidding them " guard all the  
out-lets, and they had them safe enough."  
They, upon hearing this, measured back  
their steps with rapidity, and were as quick-  
ly pursued by others, whose hoarse voices  
proceeding in different directions, announ-  
ced their approach. The fugitives were  
obliged to separate, and Louis and Henry  
entered a recess, which by its gloom fa-  
voured their concealment. Unfortunately,  
their pursuers thought proper to search it,  
and they were both discovered, conducted  
to separate apartments, and put in fetters,  
to prevent the possibility of their escape.  
Henry, reduced in mind and body by the  
Severity of his confinement, suffered himself  
to be bound without murmuring, but the  
ardent spirit of his brother Louis, disdain-  
ed confinement, and it was with difficulty  
They secured him. He demanded for  
what reason he was to be kept a pri-  
soner, and heaped curses upon them,  
but they only sneered at his impatience,  
and left him to his own thoughts. Mean-  
while M. Dupont, and those who ac-  
companied him, had found their way to  
the subterranean apartments, and by means  
of a breach made by the all-destroying  
hand of time, escaped from the walls of the  
castle. His first step was to go to court,  
where he stated to the king every circum-  
stance, and was allowed a body of soldiers  
to search the castle. They did so, but in  
vain, not a soul was to be found, all was un-  
disturbed solitude, and he was under the  
necessity of leaving his wards to their fate.  
Months passed away, but the cloud of my-  
stery was not dispelled, when one evening,  
when the family had all retired to bed, a  
violent knocking was heard at gate.  
This untimely intrusion roused M. Dupont,  
who dressed himself, and went below to  
know the cause; he found the servants  
huddled together, disputing who should  
open the gate, for since the inexplicable  
disappearance of Louis and Henry, a su-  
perstitious fear had pervaded the bosom of  
every domestic. M. Dupont ordered them  
to follow him, and he opened the gate,  
when in rushed a figure covered with blood  
and dust--a sanguine stream issuing from  
his arm, which hung lifeless at his side.  
The servants uttered a cry of terror, and  
clung round their master, when the stran-  
ger sunk on the floor, fainting through  
loss of blood. A couch was prepared for  
him, and every attempt made to recall  
departed animation, but in vain: the face  
was cleansed of the blood which besmeared  
it, and the pallid features proclaimed that  
the stranger was the lost Louis. Grieved  
to the soul to be obliged to lose him the  
moment he was found, M. Dupont exert-  
ed himself to blow into existence the latent  
spark of life, and was at length successful.  
The blood flowing from the wound in his  
arm was staunched, and a deep groan is-  
sued from his lips. The faint prospect of  
recovering him, stimulated the faithful  
guardian to new exertion, and he had at  
length the satisfaction of perceiving his  
eyes open, and a reviving cordial complete-  
ly restored him to life: But a delirious  
fever raged through his veins, and he ra-  
ved with all the incoherence of madness:  
*"his brother, his murdered brother,"* was  
the principal object on which his wander-  
ing fancy seemed to rest. Seven days he  
existed under the influence of madness,  
when his ravings subsided, and he sunk  
into a state of insensibility. M. Dupont  
was sensible that the crises of his disorder  
was at hand, and conceived his inanimate  
situation as only a prelude to dissolution.  
“Ill fated youth, he exclaimed,” evil was  
the planet that presided at thy birth, under  
its influence have all thy days been tainted  
with misfortune, and the dart of death is al-  
ready extended to deprive thee of existence.  
Small has been thy portion of happiness  
here, but thy reward is yet to come."  
The worthy owner of the chateau had  
sent for a surgeon from the neighbouring  
village as soon as he had discovered in  
the person of the wounded stranger his belov-  
ed Louis. M. Burton, the surgeon who  
was expected, was an English gentleman  
who had studied physic and surgery under  
the most eminent of the profession in Lon-  
don, but owing to some disgust he had tak-  
en to his native country, he retired to  
France, and took up his residence at the  
village in the vicinity of the chateau, where  
he continued the practice of his profession,  
with equal ability and success. He posses-  
sed a perfect knowledge of the French lan-  
guage, as he had resided in the kingdom  
for many years, and could converse on any  
subject with ease: his sentiments were ex-  
pressed without affectation, and his con-  
versation displayed superior talents and  
refinement: it may therefore be supposed,  
that he was a frequent visitant at the cha-  
teau, where his arrival was ever greeted  
with all unaffected welcome. He had  
married a French lady, by whom he had  
one daughter, and this endearing tie bound  
him still closer to the country. Upon  
Monsieur Burton's examining Louis's arm,  
while he was insensible, he found that a  
ball had been lodged there, but it was  
luckily extracted without injury. At M.  
Dupont's request, this humane gentleman,  
whose heart was ever alive to sensibility,  
consented to remain a the chateau, till rea-  
son superceded madness, or his patient  
paid "the great debt of nature." The  
crisis of his disorder was fast approaching,  
his breath grew short, and delusive hope  
was banished from every bosom, and gave  
place to despondency. Every countenance  
wore the livery of sorrow, and gave the  
strongest testimony of the love they bore  
to him; at length he appeared to have en-  
tirely ceased to suspire; all his melancho-  
ly friends were seated round the bed,  
waiting the moment when his soul should  
depart "to him who gave it." The silence  
which had reigned for some time, was at  
length interrupted by M. Burton's saying  
in a low tone, "I believe all is now over,  
but there is a possibility that he yet lives,  
and may be only sleeping." Then turning  
to one of the servants, he ordered him to  
bring him a small mirror, which he placed  
before his lips for a few minutes, and upon  
examining it found it sullied, and commu-  
nicated the pleasing intelligence to his  
mournful auditors, that he yet breathed,  
and was asleep, which he considered as a  
happy omen. Several hours did the unfor-  
tunate Louis remain perfectly insensible,  
but at length he moved, to the revival of  
the hopes of his friends, and in a few mi-  
nutes opened his eyes, and stretching out  
his hand to M. Dupont gently pressed his,  
while a faint smile gleamed across his  
countenance, on which they thought the  
unremovable seal of death had been af-  
fixed. From this time his health gradually  
returned, and in a few weeks he was able  
to leave his room, but not a word was ut-  
tered by him respecting the affairs of the  
castle, and whenever it was alluded to, it  
seemed to turn his brain to madness. As  
it seemed to affect him in such an extra-  
ordinary manner, M. Dupont deferred an  
explanation of past events, till he was per-  
fectly restored, and time had in some mea-  
sure obliterated the traces of this unknown  
misfortune from his memory, or at least de-  
stroyed the keenness of the injuries he had  
received. JULIUS

MEANWHILE the Count de Vauban,  
whose unbounded extravagance reduced  
him to the verge of ruin, was obliged to  
abscond from the importunity of his cre-  
ditors; but when Louis and Henry were  
both lost, he thought proper to come for-  
ward and claim their fortunes: at the ear-  
nest prayer of M. Dupont the grant of  
them to the Count was deferred by the king  
for one year, promising, that if in that time,  
one of them did not appear, he should be  
put in possession of them. As M. Dupont  
still entertained suspicions of the Count, he  
did not think it necessary to inform the King,  
that the lawful owner of the estates was  
found, till Louis was able to carry himself  
the evidence of it. Therefore as soon as  
he was well enough to travel, he set out,  
attended by two servants, well armed for  
the security of their master, and proceeded  
by easy stages to Paris, to claim the inves-  
titure of the states, as his age authorised the  
demand. Louis the fifteenth, who then ruled  
over that fertile and extensive kingdom,  
without hesitation ordered him to be put  
in possession of all the fortune his father  
had left, which was far from being small,  
though principally vested in the funds: his  
landed estate only consisted of the chateau  
and grounds occupied by M. Dupont.  
Upon his return, night overtook him two  
leagues from the chateau, but his desire of  
reaching it determined him to proceed,  
notwithstanding the darkness, and a wood  
which he was obliged to pass through, in  
which several robberies and murders had  
been perpetrated. He had passed through  
the greater part of it without any alarm,  
when just as he approached the farther  
side, a report of a pistol, followed by the  
clashing of swords, roused him from a re-  
verie into which he had fallen. Clapping  
spurs to his horse, he hastened forward with  
the servants at full speed; the moon at in-  
tervals shone forth from the broken clouds,  
and very opportunely yielded her light for  
him to perceive a group of men, apparent-  
ly of different parties, as the clashing of  
swords announced an encounter. Impelled  
by the natural generosity of his disposition,  
he hastened to join the weaker party, who  
thus reinforced soon put their adversaries  
to flight. A gentleman who seemed to be  
the superior of the party, was slightly  
wounded, and thro’ fear of its being irri-  
tated by riding far, he accepted an invita-  
tion to the chateau, which he had accorded  
in the politest terms. They found M. Dupont  
and his family expecting Louis with anxie-  
ty, and his guests they treated with the  
most hospitable politeness. Before they  
retired, Louis begged to know what had  
occasioned the rencounter in the forest, and  
whom it was he had the good fortune to  
assist upon that occasion. The stranger  
informed him, that he was no other than  
the Duke of Alencon, who upon his way  
to his seat a short distance beyond the cha-  
teau, had the misfortune of breaking his  
carriage, and as he did not wish to stay  
till it was repaired, he proceeded on horse-  
back with a few servants, and in the forest  
had been attacked by some men, whom he  
supposed to be banditti. He overwhelm-  
ed Louis with his thanks, and the next  
morning insisted upon his accompanying  
him to his castle, to which he consented, as  
the easy behaviour of the Duke had entire-  
ly won his confidence. He remained with  
him several weeks, and every day raised  
them in each other's estimation, till Louis  
had resolved to open his whole soul to him.  
This he deferred till his venerable guardian  
should come to the castle, whither he had  
been urged to present himself. The Duke  
of Alencon had one son and one daughter,  
to whom all his immense estates would be-  
long; the daughter possessed all the graces  
of the sex, but her brother the Marquis de  
Lantz, disgraced his distinguished rank by  
his vicious propensities. Antoniette de  
Lantz (this was the Duke's family name)  
had been universally admired, and Louis  
understood that a young nobleman, who  
was one of her suitors, was favoured by  
the Marquis, and approved by Alencon.  
Notwithstanding the caution which this  
information was calculated to give, young  
Boileau could not exclude the passion of  
love from his bosom, and the image of An-  
toniette haunted him continually. At length  
he was told that the lover of Mademoiselle  
de Lantz, was expected at the castle the  
day following, and the day after M. Dupont  
had announced his intention of visiting the  
Duke. Curiosity to see the man to whom  
his admired Antoniette would probably be  
joined in the bands of marriage, prevented  
him from sleeping, and he arose early the  
next morning, with his ideas occupied by  
the same subject. After he had breakfast-  
ed, he remained in the parlour with the  
Duke, Antoniette and the Marquis, when  
a carriage drove into the yard. "It is the  
Count," exclaims the Marquis, and flew out  
of the room to receive him, while Louis  
walked to one of the windows and saw a  
light from his carriage the *Count de Vauban*.  
Astonishment transfixed him to the spot,  
and contradictory ideas passed through his  
brain with such rapidity, as almost to de-  
range him. To find his uncle, whom he  
strongly suspected of being the source of all  
his misfortunes, received into the family of  
the Duke of Alencon, as the approved lo-  
ver of his daughter, almost surpassed com-  
prehension. He however, fortunately re-  
covered his presence of mind, before the  
Count entered the room, and determined  
to observe his countenance with the most  
watchful scrutiny. De Vauban entered,  
introduced by the Marquis with smiles in  
his aspect, when his attention was arrested  
by the sight of his nephew, his counte-  
nance displayed contending emotions, and  
guilt and fear were delineated in every  
feature. The company observed the ex-  
traordinary confusion of the Count, and  
were at a loss to account for it, or the pier-  
cing attention with which Louis regarded  
him: but in a short time de Vauban's wont-  
ed ease of manners returned, and he paid his  
compliments to the company, apologizing  
for his emotion, which he said was to be at-  
tributed to his surprise, at again seeing his  
runaway nephew, who he had much feared  
had been lost to his friends for ever. He  
then acquainted the company with their  
consanguinity, but was completely at a loss  
to enter into conversation with Louis, who  
sat totally silent wrapt in his own reflections.  
To all their enquiries respecting his absence,  
of which the Count had spoken, he gave  
incoherent replies, and instantly relapsed  
into his abstraction of mind to what was  
passing before him. The day passed with a  
degree of unsociability, to which the fam-  
ily of the Duke of Alencon were unaccus-  
tomed, but the unusual reserve, to them so  
mysterious, which clouded the manners of  
their two guests, deprived them of their  
wonted cheerfulness. The Duke, to whom  
Louis had endeared himself in the first place,  
by according him his assistance when be-  
set in the forest, with so much celerity, and  
which his affectionate manners had confirm-  
ed, was anxious to know what occasioned the  
uneasiness under which his young friend  
seemed to labour, and they all separated to  
retire to bed at night, seemingly pleased  
that the day was expired. Louis was un-  
able to sleep, from the concurrence of cir-  
cumstances which a short time had produ-  
ced; the confusion of the Count upon their  
interview, almost confirmed his suspicions  
that he was the cause of his imprisonment.  
Restless and tormented with his own ideas,  
he arose, dressed and seated himself at the  
window;--opening the casement to give  
admission to the air, he observed a man  
walking on the terrace below, apparently  
waiting for some one, and in a few minutes  
he was joined by another. The casement  
at which he sat, was too high from the ter-  
race to permit him to hear the whole of  
the discourse that ensued, but he found  
that it was an assignation. Curiosity to  
know who it was that had taken this oppor-  
tunity for a private interview, prompted  
him to listen, and he found it was the Mar-  
quis and the Count de Vauban. He was  
so much interested in every thing which  
concerned his uncle, that he could not re-  
frain from listening, and from what part of  
their discourse reached his ear, he found it  
of dreadful import. He had conceived a  
dislike to the Marquis at first sight, which  
had been strengthened by his manners to-  
wards him, but he now found him to be  
a man, in whom every species of villainy  
were concentrated. The attack made up-  
on the Duke of Alencon in the forest,  
where Louis had been the means of his res-  
cue, had been the act of the Count's des-  
perate dependants under his influence. De  
Vauban's situation with respect to pecuni-  
ary affairs, was desperate, and in order to rid  
himself of the importunity of his creditors,  
he had afforded protection to a party of  
banditti, who resided in the environs of  
the Castle, which had been the scene of the  
Boileaus' imprisonment. From this place  
They made depredations throughout the vi-  
cinity, and a considerable dividend of their  
plunder was appropriated to the use of de  
Vauban. But as this was a very uncer-  
tain dependence, the Count had listened  
to proposals from the Marquis de Lantz,  
who also felt his extravagance limited by  
the prudence of the Duke, to assassinate his  
father, and share with him the large estates  
which would then come into his possession.  
This horrid scheme, of which Louis had  
been the means of disappointing, plainly  
proves that de Vauban Would hesitate at  
nothing, that had a tendency to promote  
his views. The conversation then turned  
upon Louis, and the Count de Vauban re-  
lated to the Marquis the obstacle he was  
to the possession of M. Boileau's estate,  
and communicated his desire of having him  
removed, to his worthless companion, who  
readily assented to his intentions, and they  
removed to another part of the terrace to  
lay the plan of their future proceedings.  
The horror which pervaded the breast of  
Louis was indescribable; to find that any  
Human being should be so lost to every  
sense of rectitude, as to not only connive  
at, but to assist in an attempt, to murder his  
*own father*, was more than he could ever have  
supposed. Nothing more transpired of their  
intentions that night, and the day dawned  
upon Louis, while he remained fixed at the  
casement so deeply wrapt in meditation,  
and he was scarcely conscious of his exis-  
tence. When roused from his reveries,  
he was almost ready to conclude that it was  
a horrid dream; but memory recalled to  
his imagination the conversation he had  
heard, too forcibly to suffer him to admit  
the pleasing supposition. The next day  
brought M. Dupont to the Castle de Alen-  
con, and as soon as possible a private in-  
terview was obtained·with Louis and the  
Duke, when, after receiving the request of  
his two friends, Louis racapitulated his ad-  
ventures in the castle.  
  
\[5. 30 May 1801\]  
  
(Continued.)  
  
HE commenced his relation, when him-  
self and Henry were separated from M.  
Dupont, and entered the recess. He re-  
counted the insults he received upon his  
being found, and, together with his bro-  
ther, being closely confined in irons. His daily  
pittance was brought him by a ruffian, whose  
countenance indicated villainy of the deep-  
est dye; to all his requests to know by  
whose authority, and for what reason he  
was kept a prisoner, no answer was return-  
ed, nor could all his entreaties procure him  
information of the fate of Henry. All was  
incertitude, and his imagination conjured  
up the form of Henry, receiving his death-  
wound from the hand of an assassin, who  
would next plunge the weapon, perhaps  
yet reeking in his brother's gore, into his  
own bosom. A few days only had elapsed,  
when his keeper entered the prison, ac-  
companied by two others, and he was led  
out, (the two men following him with  
drawn swords,) and conveyed through the  
subterranean apartments, to a remote place,  
where he naturally concluded his life was  
to be terminated. But he was mistaken, for  
he had soon the pleasure of seeing Henry  
conducted into the same apartment, which  
was filled with armed men, and found that  
their removal was on account of a body of  
troops under M. Dupont, approaching to  
search the castle. They distinctly heard  
them at a distance in the building, and the  
hopes of the prisoners began to revive; but  
after a few hours had elapsed, they had the  
mortification of hearing them depart, and  
all the fond visions of liberty, which fancy  
had created, vanished, and gloomy despair  
usurped their place.-- No embrace was  
permitted them, nor were they allowed  
to speak to each other, and they were con-  
ducted back to their cells without enjoying  
any satisfaction from the interview, but  
what Louis derived from seeing the youth  
of his brother, bearing up against the ill ef-  
fects of confinement, and his recovering his  
health notwithstanding all his misfortunes.  
But his own countenance could convey no  
such satisfaction to his brother, for it bore  
the stamp of melancholy, and when a smile  
illuminated his pallid features upon the ap-  
pearance of Henry, like the gleam of a  
meteor in a watery atmosphere, it quickly  
disappeared. The same dull routine occu-  
pied the time of his imprisonment, without  
any material occurrence, when one even-  
ing after the guard had seen him for the  
last time that night, as he was pacing with  
"heavy steps and slow" the floor of his  
prison, a dismal long-drawn groan, reach-  
ed his ear. His chains had been taken off  
some time, as his keepers supposed the door  
secured with massy bars and bolts, suffice-  
ent. The idea that this horrid sound might  
be the last groan of his brother, roused into  
exertion all his dormant faculties, which had  
sunk through inactivity into nerveless indo-  
lence. He examined the door, and to his  
inexpressible surprise he found it had been  
left unfastened through the negligence of  
his keeper; taking advantage of this lucky  
occurrence, he issued from his prison, and  
passed hastily along the passage; a door  
half open arrested his progress, and an ir-  
resistable impulse urged him to inspect the  
room. A lamp suspended from the ceiling,  
in the same manner as in the cell where he  
had been confined, afforded its glimmering  
light, and presented to his view a scene  
replete with horror. It was the body of  
his brother Henry, laying in his gore, who  
thus in the spring of life, ere he had tasted  
its pleasures, had bidden them adieu for  
ever. Driven to distraction by the horrific  
appearance, he rushed out of the room, and  
flew along the passage with such rapidity,  
that he would have been mistaken for an  
aerial being, the sound of whose footsteps  
were not perceptible to mortal ear. Not  
knowing whither it led, he pursued the  
avenue till it terminated in a postern gate,  
which was open, and where two centinels  
were stationed. With the velocity of light-  
ning he flew past them, and, unconscious  
of the action, quitted the hated walls which  
had been productive of so much misery to  
himself and his loved Henry, leaving the  
centinels stupefied with surprise and terror.  
But ere Louis could proceed far from the  
castle they recalled their scattered faculties,  
and discharged their muskets in the direc-  
tion he had taken, and with two much suc-  
cess, for the contents of one of them was  
lodged in his arm, and felled him to the  
earth. Animated with almost supernatural  
strength, he arose and resumed his progress  
towards the chateau, which he just reached  
when all his strength failed him, and he  
sunk into a state of total insensibility, as has  
been mentioned before.  
  
When Louis had finished his relation, a  
consultation was held upon the most proba-  
ble means to evade any future attacks  
which might be made on his person. To  
relate the conversation young Boileau had  
overheard the preceding night, would  
give the Duke of Alencon too severe a  
shock, he therefore deferred speaking of it  
till he could have a private interview with  
M. Dupont, and as the suspicions of the whole  
party attached to the Count, it was resolved  
that they should return the same day to the  
chateau; the Duke intended to take the first  
opportunity to dismiss the Count, and de-  
stroy all his hopes of an alliance with his  
daughter. Agreeable to the plan they had  
adopted, M. Dupont and Louis returned  
to the chateau; and the same afternoon the  
Count de Vauban, in a private conference  
With the Duke of Alencon, avowed his at-  
tachment to Mademoiselle de Lantz, and  
demanded her hand in marriage. The pro-  
posal was rejected in the most civil terms,  
to the great surprize, and mortification of  
de Vauban, who, after a secret inter-  
view with the Marquis, departed from the  
castle.  
  
Arrived at such an advanced period of  
our history, let us take a review of the life  
of de Vauban, as far as concerns his ne-  
phews. Possessing a perfect knowledge  
of his brother's wealth, he no sooner receiv-  
ed the intelligence of his death, than he  
conceived the: nefarious design on remov-  
ing his nephews by force, and enjoying  
the uninterrupted possession of the estate.  
The execution of his purpose would how-  
ever be attended with difficulty, but he  
was not to be discouraged, and he concert-  
ed his plan with precision, determined by  
perseverance to surmount every obstacle.  
His dependents were numerous, and he  
well knew would execute any thing he  
could wish. For the purpose of securing  
his nephews, he stationed a number of the  
villains under his protection in the castle,  
some parts of which, were in a ruinous si-  
tuation, and when M. Dupont retired  
with his wards to his country seat, de  
Vauban, who frequently visited them, dili-  
gently explored every part of the building,  
and found the ruined wing communicated  
by narrow passages with that in which the  
family resided. Ever on the watch for an  
opportunity to reduce his plans to practice,  
he discovered in the apartment assigned  
to Henry, a private door, which was en-  
tirely unknown to any of the family. Thro'  
this he gave admission in the night to some  
of his ruffian attendants, who conveyed  
Henry to the castle, where he was con-  
Fined in a damp prison, and fettered. No  
Ray of light illuminated the obscurity of  
The dungeon, nor served to cheer his me-  
lancholy situation, save what one glimmer-  
ing taper afforded. A superstitious fear  
prevented de Vauban's immediately order-  
ing the assassination of Henry, but he left  
him a pray to torturing sensations, and the  
pestiferous atmosphere of his prison. But  
when he learned the arrival of M. Dupont's  
family in the neighbourhood, the fear of  
being discovered induced him to order  
Henry's death, and insure his own safety:  
but this unfortunate termination of his life,  
was prevented by the timely interposition  
of Louis, in the vaults of the castle, when  
Gerald paid the forfeit of his crimes. Lou-  
is for a considerable time eluded the vigi-  
lance of his uncle, till the unfortunate ad-  
venture of exploring the castle, when he  
fell a victim to his temerity. The Count  
carefully kept his abused nephews in un-  
certainty respecting the author of their  
misfortunes, lest any unavoidable accident,  
which his guilty and mistrustful conscience  
could not foresee or guard against, should  
give them their liberty, and raise an in-  
controvertible evidence of his guilt. Be-  
ing disappointed in his expectations of im-  
mediate possession of M. Boileau's estate,  
he obtained an introduction to the family  
of Alencon, through the medium of the  
Marquis, whom he had often met at the  
gaming table: hoping to recruit his dis-  
ordered and almost exhausted finances, by  
a marriage with Antoniette. Fearful of his  
anger, his dependents forbore to mention  
to him the escape of Louis, and he had no  
reason to suppose he had eluded his vil-  
lainous intentions, till he met him at the  
Duke of Alencon's castle. The surprize  
the sight of him occasioned, roused in his  
bosom the dormant spark of shame, and  
kindled the confusion which shone in his  
countenance. When his nephew had de-  
parted to the chateau, and he met with the  
unexpected rejection of his proposals, on the  
part of the duke, his enmity to Louis, who  
he supposed had influenced the decision of  
the Duke, was redoubled, and he vowed  
the most sanguinary revenge. He depart-  
ed sullen and mortified, for his castle, which  
he had previously put in a state of defence,  
as his capacious mind had prepared against  
the evils of adversity, and admitted the pos-  
sibility of his experiencing the frowns of for-  
tune, and being obliged to recur to his  
predatory system for support. Here, with  
his band of ruffians, he resided, and spread  
terror and devastation throughout the vi-  
cinity. The Marquis being himself re-  
stricted by his father, in his pecuniary af-  
fairs, could afford him no assistance, and  
tired with his frequent importunities, broke  
the bonds of intimacy which had united  
them. Had not the Marquis been of a  
timid disposition, had he been endowed  
with the daring courage of de Vauban, he  
would have been a paricide, for he had a  
heart sufficiently corrupted to harbour the  
attrocious design.

(Continued.)  
  
THE Count de Vauban had been long  
invisible at the metropolis, being so much  
engaged in his plans to get Louis again in  
his hands. But as soon as the intelligence  
reached M. Dupont, of de Vauban's being  
at the head of the banditti which infested  
the vicinity, he prepared to remove to Paris,  
sensible that when in possession of power,  
he would regard no law, human or divine, to  
effect his infamous purposes, and glut his  
sanguinary revenge on Louis. Once alone  
did de Vauban find an opportunity to make  
an attempt upon the person of Louis,  
which was before the commencement of  
their journey to Paris, when one night he  
made an assault upon the chateau, hoping  
to be able to force his entrance. But the  
family were roused at the first attack, and  
seizing all the warlike weapons which they  
could find in the house, they obliged them  
to retire. It was a fortunate circumstance  
that the owner of the chateau, upon the  
first intelligence of the existence of a band  
of robbers in the neighbourhood, had pro-  
cured musquets and ammunition, in order  
to be prepared against any event. This  
occurrence hastened their departure, and  
the next day they set out for the capital,  
where they had prepared a residence.  
Vice seldom fails ultimately to receive its  
punishment, and the marquis de Lantz was  
another instance of the reward of villainy,  
whether executed or 1nercly concerted.  
'Tis true the imbecility of his mind and  
his cowardice, prevented the execution of  
his unnatural designs against the life of his  
father, but it did not diminish his atrocity  
in the conception of such an idea. He had  
made an excursion to Dijon, where, among  
his careless unthinking companions, he had  
been passing away the tardy hours, and was  
returning home for want of the necessary  
money to support his extravagance. He had  
not recovered from the influence of  
wine, when he entered the forest, which  
had been the theatre of murder perpetrated  
by the lawless dependents of de Vauban.  
He had sunk into a slumber, and the spell  
which bound him in the embraces of Mor-  
pheus, was so potent, that he heard not  
the whistle of the banditti, nor knew of  
their approach, till his attendants were fi-  
red upon by them. All who could fly, made  
their escape, as no tie attached them to the  
fate of de Lantz, who scarcely was roused  
from his stupidity, till the robbers roughly  
ordered him to deliver up his money. This  
demand he was unable to comply with, as  
he had spent the last livre at the gaming-  
table. Wine inspired him with something  
like courage, of which his natural dispose-  
tion was entirely destitute, and snatching  
up his pistol that lay at his side, he dis-  
charged it at the person next to him. This  
was the signal of his fate, the murderers  
instantly dragged him from his carriage,  
and buried their poignards in his bosom.  
Thus was the miserable death of this  
wretched being, whose heart was never  
inspired with one sentiment that would  
reflect honour on himself, accomplished by  
the means of his colleague in the attroci-  
ous attempt, to deprive his father of life.  
Such was the end of a life which that one  
crime indeliably stained, and which, had he  
possessed the tallents of the Count de Vau-  
ban, would have been productive of more  
mischief to society. Soon as the murder-  
ers had satiated their revenge and taken  
ample vengeance for the wound he had  
given their comrade, they returned to the  
castle to dispose of the trifling booty they  
had obtained, and convey the wounded ruf-  
fian. The Count possessed sufficient sa-  
gacity to know, that his petty despotism  
would be of short continuance, as the out-  
rages the banditti under his command, had  
committed in the province, much shortly,  
reach the royal ear; and the consequence  
would be fatal to him, but it was too late  
to think of obtaining pardon, and he flatter-  
ed himself that he could make his escape at  
any time, when imperious necessity should  
command such a proceeding. Had the Count  
de Vauban been educated in the principles  
of virtue, he would probably have become  
an ornament to society, but unlimited indul-  
gence had suffered his good qualities to be  
obscured, and by the continued practice of  
engaging in bachanalian festivals and carou-  
sals, his heart became at last as depraved  
as we behold it. When M. Dupont arriv-  
ed at Paris, he made a report to the king  
of the numerous murders and robberies that  
had been committed in the province of  
Burgundy. The Duke of Alencon also,  
who mourned his son cut of in the prime  
of life by the hands of lawless ruffians, was  
determined to destroy the combination of  
the villains who infested this fertile part of  
the kingdom, and revenge the death of his  
son. His influence at court was conside-  
rable, and he was permitted by the king  
to lead a body of the regular troops against  
the Count, to conduct him to the capital  
if he made a voluntary surrender of his  
person or in case of resistance, to destroy  
the haunt of the banditti, and bring him  
to condign punishment. In order to pre-  
vent the escape of the Count, the Duke of  
Alencon, accompanied by Louis Boileau,  
and M. Dupont, with the troops under  
his authority, marched towards the castle  
with rapidity, lest the intelligence of their  
approach should give the alarm, and de  
Vauban escape the fate due to his attroci-  
ous guilt. But all their caution did not  
prevent his receiving notice of their arri-  
val, and acting according to the dictates  
of prudence. With every necessary pre-  
caution to prevent a surprize from the ban-  
ditti, the troops invested the castle, and  
a messenger was dispatched to demand the  
surrender of it to his Majesty's commission,  
a refusal was the answer, unless the com-  
mandant of the party would pledge his hon-  
our to procure them a free pardon. This  
offer was not accepted, and they were or-  
dered to surrender unconditionally, de-  
pending on the clemency of the king, or  
death was denounced as their portion, the  
instant they were taken. Inflated with  
visionary ideas of the strength of the for-  
tifications, and confident of the plenty  
which abounded from the stores of provi-  
sion, which the provident Count had taken  
care to lay up, they bid defiance to regal  
authority, and dared them to the assault.  
Several petty conflicts were maintained  
with the banditti, who, though inferior in  
point of numbers, counterbalanced it by  
their ferocity, and several were killed on  
either side. To conquer or die, was the  
maxim the ruffian defenders of the castle  
faithfully adhered to, and the soldiers of  
the royal party were unable to obtain any  
advantage. Finding they made but very  
little progress towards the object of their  
excursion, the leaders of the detachment  
determined upon a vigorous attempt to  
overcome all resistance. For this purpose  
they prepared torches and fire-brands, re-  
solved to set fire to the castle, and bury  
its infatuated inhabitants in the ruins. Hu-  
manity however induced them to make a  
final offer of conditional pardon, if they  
would give up the arm of justice the  
Count de Vauban. The proposal was re-  
jected by the banditti with disdain, for al-  
though dead to every sentiment of recti-  
tude and humanity, the imaginary tie of  
honour bound them to the Count, and they  
resolved to procure his pardon or perish  
with him. JULIUS.

(Continued.)  
  
FINDING all attempts to induce the  
banditti to except the intended pardon were  
futile, they prepared to carry the plan of  
burning the castle into execution. Having  
made every necessary preparation, the lead-  
ers of the troops assigned to each the part  
they were to act, and an hour after the sun  
had sunk beneath the horizon, the signal  
for the attack was given, by throwing a  
rocket from the General's tent. The sol-  
diers rushed forward to the onset, brandish-  
ing their torches, and after a severe conflict,  
gained the out-works of the castle. In a  
short time the conflagration was general,  
and the gleams of light proceeding from it,  
and to the darkness which prevailed, ren-  
dered it a scene of horror. Having accom-  
plished the design of setting the castle on  
fire, the troops retreated to guard all the  
out-lets, that those who escaped the fury  
of the raging element, should fall by the a-  
venging sword. A body of the banditti, with  
the Count at their head, sallied from the  
castle, to endeavour to cut their way thro'  
the hostile party. But the principal part of  
them fell in the attempt, and among them,  
the infamous De Vauban.  
  
Louis as soon as he perceived the flames  
bursting from all parts of the castle, and the  
towering ramparts enveloped in spoke, ap-  
proached the walls: the sally of the bandit-  
ti had been made on a different side, and  
had not attracted his attention from the scene  
of ruin before him. While he was contem-  
plating the destruction which was taking  
place, his attention was arrested by the  
sight of a person leaping from one rampart  
to another, to escape the threatening flames  
which pursued him, and in which he ap-  
peared to be almost involved. At length,  
by means of his surprising activity, he ap-  
proached towards the place where Louis  
stood, but still at such a height, that his es-  
cape seemed almost impossible. He had  
considerably descended since Louis first  
noticed him, and now paused, apparent-  
ly contemplating his height from the  
ground, and dubious of his ability to reach  
it in safety. But the flames approached,  
he sprung from the walls, and fell almost at  
the feet of Louis, who raised his arm to  
terminate his life, but an impulse of huma-  
nity induced him to spare it, if indeed he  
had not been killed by the fall. Young Boi-  
leau laid his hand on his heart, and felt it  
beat. The horizon was illuminated by the  
conflagration, and as he inclined himself,  
to see if the spark of life was extinguished,  
he observed the stranger was dressed differ-  
ently from the common banditti. Strange  
emotions agitated his bosom, and "hope,  
the fond deceiver," fluttered round his  
heart. He approached to inspect the fig-  
ure which lay prostrate before him, cover-  
ed with dust, and stunned with the fall.  
He gently raised him from the ground, and  
as the light gleamed on his ashy counte-  
nance, discovered him to be--HIS LONG  
LOST BROTHER!----Reader, conceive his  
sensations, for words cannot express them;  
no language could convey them to thee,  
though all the eloquence of TULLY was  
exhausted to effect it. His astonishment  
almost surpassed conception--Had he not  
beheld him prostrate on the floor of his cell,  
his life's blood streaming from his bosom?--  
Had he not seen him a palled corpse, the  
victim of fell revenge?--And now, did he  
not see him before him? did not his arms  
support him?--All that had passed ap-  
peared as a fearful dream, the offspring of  
a disordered fancy. He called loudly for  
assistance, and had him conveyed to his  
tent, where they successfully endeavoured  
to restore l1im to existence, but he had re-  
ceived some very severe contusions from the  
fall, and his arm appeared considerably  
scorched.  
  
The next day, as soon as the dawn oppo-  
sed its pleasing light to the more awful ap-  
pearance of the castle, which exhibited one  
vast sheet of flame, our new-found invalid  
was conveyed to the hospitable mansion of  
Monsieur Burton, where M. Dupont and  
Louis were kindly urged to take up their  
residence. A few weeks crowned the as-  
siduities of the amiable surgeon and his  
friends with success, and they had the in-  
expressible satisfaction of seeing their be-  
loved Henry, whom they very naturally had  
long concluded, was traversing the regions  
of eternity, restored to all his former health  
and vigour. Happiness they yet hoped was  
in store for them, since De Vauban, the  
grand and only enemy to their happiness,  
had fell the victim to the justice of his of-  
fended country. Carrying his resentment  
no farther than to see the execution of jus-  
tice on the vile disturbers of the public tran-  
quility, the Duke of Alencon, with his usu-  
al humanity, ordered that the bodies of the  
banditti should receive decent burial, and  
every rite be performed, that, according  
to the forms of the Romish church, was ne-  
cessary to remove all obstacles from their  
road to heaven. Soon as the bodies of these  
infatuated wretches were committed to the  
embraces of their mother earth, the troops  
commenced their march, to return to the  
capital, and the Duke retired to his cas-  
tle to receive from the filial assiduities of  
his daughter, consolation for the untimely  
death of his son. Ignorance frequently con-  
duces more to our happiness than knowl-  
edge, and had de Alencon known of the in-  
famous design of his son, he would not  
have stood in need of any consolation. Hen-  
ry upon his restoration to health, complied  
with the desires of his friends, and thus com-  
menced the relation of his misfortunes.  
"You, my kind friends, must certainly  
have been greatly astonished, when you  
found my chamber vacant, and per-  
ceive no traces of my having left the room;  
but your surprise could not have equalled  
mine, when about midnight, without any  
previous noise which would have announced  
the entrance of any person, (especially as  
the door was fastened within) I saw by the  
light the lamp burning in the chimney  
afforded, a man standing by my bed-side. I  
demanded his business in my chamber, at  
such an unseasonable hour, but he instant-  
ly drew a pistol from his pocket, and order-  
ed me to dress immediately, and without  
noise, as the least attempt to alarm the  
family should be attended with death. Re-  
sistance was vain, and I according com-  
plied with his demand in silence: as soon  
as dressing was finished, he bade me attend  
him, and removing a pannel in the parti-  
tion, I discovered a secret-door, which he  
opened, and we passed through. We now  
entered several apartments, which the  
noisome atmosphere, and decayed furniture  
declared had been long deserted, and re-  
signed to the all-destroying hand of time.  
Here, still holding the pistol in his hand,  
he obliged me to walk before him. Before  
we left the building, he was joined by sev-  
eral other ruffians, whose countenances  
plainly denoted their villainous characters,  
and that they were fit instruments to ac-  
complish any design which villainy could  
conceive. When we made an exit from  
the mansion, we found a carriage waiting,  
into which three of the ruffians entered  
with myself. We proceeded with amazing  
rapidity I knew not Whither, but my heart  
sunk within me, at the strange pro-  
ceedings, and mysterious silence of my  
companions: at length the dawn broke up-  
on us, as we attained the summit of a steep  
hill. At any other time, and almost in any  
other situation, I should have beheld the  
surrounding scenery with delight, but my  
mind was a pray to despondency, and the  
most gloomy prospect appeared before me.  
In vain did I request of my companions to  
inform me Whither I was to be led, for they  
preserved a uniform and uninterrupted si-  
lence, except when the leader of the party  
as he appeared to be, cautioned me to make  
no noise, as he said it would be instant-  
neously punished. I could not forbear ta-  
king a retrospective view of the happy past,  
and comparing it with my present forlorn  
situation. Surrounded by ruffians, who it  
was evident, had some villainous design  
upon me, hope almost forsook me, and I  
only beheld in perspective, either a life  
dragged out in chains and misery, or a ter-  
mination to my sufferings, by an untimely  
death. In vain did I pray my companions  
to give me some clue to guide me through  
this labyrinth of uncertainty, they deigned  
not to answer me, unless to reprehend me  
for my loquacity. But why am I thus fa-  
tiguing you with a detail of my sensations,  
during this memorable journey, memorable  
to me, as it will ever be a distinguished  
æra of my life; to be brief, I arrived, after  
a tiresome journey, at the castle, without  
having left the carriage for a moment; as  
provision had been made to avoid the ne-  
cessity. Having alighted from the car-  
riage, I was immediately conducted to the  
dreary dungeon from whence the magna-  
nimity of my beloved brother released me.  
When I was secured by chains in this hor-  
rible place, my guide condescended to open  
his lips, and inform me, that here the re-  
mainder of my days Was to be spent, that  
here I was to drag out in misery; the rem-  
nant of my life, which till then had been spent  
in a course of uninterrupted felicity, ex-  
cept when the death of my father, for a  
time, cast a shade over my happiness. I then  
repeated my request to know by whom,  
and for what motive, I was thus severely  
punished, but I could obtain no answer  
from the monster, and I thought I could  
perceive a horrid smile of satisfaction,  
gleam across his countenance, at having  
thus doomed fellow creature to be mise-  
rable, as long as life remained. From that  
day till the time I was delivered from the  
murderous designs of my enemies, I held  
no converse with any human being, my  
food which was of the most ordinary kind,  
was daily delivered me by one of those vil-  
lains, who had escorted me to the castle.  
Grief and the dampness of my dungeon,  
Was bringing me rapidly to the verge of the  
grave, when Louis intervened and snatched  
me from the jaws of destruction. The pros-  
pect of liberty was now before me, and it is,  
only for the man, who has been as long con-  
fined within the gloomy walls of a dungeon,  
to conceive my sensations. But not long  
was I permitted to indulge the flattering  
hope, as we were so soon taken, and I again  
became the victim of tyranny. To whom  
was to be attributed all my misfortunes, I  
was totally ignorant; but my condition was  
comparatively enviable, to that from which  
I had emerged, as my prison was dry and  
comfortable. The cheering rays of the sun  
penetrated my cell, and to me who had so  
long been deprived of the enlivening sight,  
it was indeed a pleasure. I was but a short  
time oppressed with the weight of my irons,  
for to what motive it was to be attributed  
I know not, but I suppose they conceived  
my escape impossible, and I was suffered  
to enjoy the valuable privilege of traversing  
my narrow cell; my constitution had be-  
come inured to confinement, although the  
disappointment I suffered in being depri-  
ved of the blessings of liberty, when I had  
supposed it within my grasp, did not by  
any means tend to strengthen my patience.  
You have already heard from Louis, of our  
interview in the vaults of the castle, and  
when I was led back to my cell, the hor-  
ror of continual imprisonment, seemed to  
occupy the whole of the dreary prospect.  
Disappointment had soured my temper,  
and I gave myself up a prey to desponden-  
cy. To my repeated requests to receive  
information respecting Louis, my keeper  
used to seldom reply without equivocation,  
and sometimes he would answer in a way  
that roused my passions, dormant only for  
want of something to call them into action;  
one night when he entered my cell, to  
see that every thing was in the situation he  
chose it to be, I inquired after Louis, and his  
answer was accompanied with bitter taunts  
at my defenceless situation. This I sup-  
pose was occasioned by some incident, that  
had occurred to ruffle his temper, and he  
took the opportunity to vent on me his  
spleen. My temper, soured by misfortune,  
was unprepared to endure this new and un-  
provoked treatment, and I heaped on him  
reproaches for his villainy, and bestowed  
on him every term which my resentment  
could suggest. Fired by this unusual retort,  
and stung with my merited reproaches, he  
drew a dagger from his bosom, and dart-  
ed upon me, aimed it at my heart.

(Continued.)  
  
ALL conception from this moment failed  
me, and, upon returning to life, I found  
myself on a bed in a cell, similar to that in  
which I had been confined. I was attend-  
ed by some of the ruffians, whose motives  
for their present attention I could not scan.  
Whether they were actuated by humanity,  
or whether remorse had stung the villain  
who had attempted my assassination, I could  
not tell, tho' from what knowledge of their  
dispositions I had gathered from painful ex-  
perience, I rather supposed it was the re-  
proaches of conscience, not yet grown cal-  
lous by repeated acts of barbarity. To  
whatever cause their conduct was to· be at-  
tributed, whether to sensations of remorse,  
or the dictates of compassion, I was soon  
convinced the sentiment was short-lived, and  
had expired with returning animation; for  
soon as I had emerged from the state of in-  
sensibility into which I had fallen, their as-  
siduities gradually decreased, and my only  
assistance was in the strength of my con-  
stitution, which safely bore me through the  
strange vicissitudes of my fate. My con-  
valescence was tedious and painful; I had  
lost a considerable quantity of blood, which  
occasioned extraordinary debility, and my  
wound was deep. I had received the  
dagger of the assassin in my breast, and  
surely it is to be attributed to the intervene-  
tion of my guardian angel, that I escaped  
the impending destruction. My debility  
was so extreme, that my guards did not  
think it necessary to secure the door with  
more fastenings than a simple bolt, which  
was in itself ample security; for my strength  
and ardour were too much exhausted, to  
make an attempt to regain my liberty, had  
the fairest prospect been opened before me.  
At length the ability of my only nurse,  
"Dame Nature," restored me by the geni-  
al influence of sleep (the enjoyment of  
which was a pleasure I had not for some  
time been gratified with) to the blessings of  
health. I had scarcely retrieved the posses-  
sion of this glorious blessing, which had  
been so long banished from, when the  
royal troops encompassed the castle, to a-  
venge my wrongs on the author of all my  
misfortunes. I longed for an opportunity  
to join the detachment, and assert my own  
cause,--my ardour disdained to be confin-  
ed within the circumscribed limits of my  
prison, but my power would not second  
the inspiration. The tardy hours seemed  
to have almost ceased to revolve, my heart  
was with my brother, but my arms, which  
ought to have been extended, to hurl the  
bolt of vengeance on the heads of my op-  
pressors, were imprisoned within the walls  
of the hateful castle. At length arrived the  
night Of horror, when the polluted walls of  
the castle, which screened the guilty ruffians  
from the hands of justice tottered to their  
foundations; when the "cloud-cap't tow-  
ers" trembled with the intensity of the  
heat, and threatened ruin to all beneath  
them. I had notice of the commencement  
of the conflagration by the gleams of light  
which illuminated the horizon, and render-  
ed "darkness, visible." A horrible death  
was now before me and the innate princi-  
ple, inherent in the breast of man, that  
of self-preservation, induced me to exam-  
ine the door of my apartment. But the faint  
hope, that some one actuated by humanity,  
might have left it unsecured, vanished. The  
flames gradually increased, and already en-  
veloped the towering ramparts, when the  
bustle in the castle announced some uncom-  
mon attempt to escape the devouring ele-  
ment, which was making rapid strides to  
involve the whole of the inhabitants in one  
common destruction. Abhorring a death  
so painful as was presented to me, I endea-  
voured to loosen the bars with which the  
window was secured, and alight on the bat-  
tlements. The urgency of my situation in-  
spired me with uncommon strength,--I suc-  
ceeded in the attempt to escape from the  
window, and reached the battlements in  
safety. I was nearly at the summit of  
the castle, and all below me was involved  
in smoke, from which at intervals the flames  
would burst forth, and aspire to the high-  
est turrets. Perseverance and composure,  
aided by my exertions, surmounted every  
obstacle, and I at length reached the ground,  
with only a trifling burn I received as I rush-  
ed through the flames. Thus, my kind and  
compassionate friends, you have heard the  
whole of my unfortunate story in detail,  
and situated as I now am, surrounded by  
those who endear existence to me, I defy  
all the storms of fate, and the frowns of  
fortune, Hope befriends me, and whis-  
pers to my heart, That happiness shall a-  
gain be mine."  
  
Tranquillity being thus restored to  
the family of Dupont and his wards, whom  
he regarded with paternal love, the chateau  
was re-occupied, and Louis made an ex-  
cursion to the Castle de Alencon, where  
he was received with an unaffected wel-  
come. No obstacle recurring to oppose  
his wish, to pay his addresses to the love-  
ly Antoinette, he took the first opportuni-  
ty of a secret interview, to offer his heart  
and hand to her acceptance. Free from  
affectation, Mademoiselle de Lantz avow-  
ed a reciprocal attachment, and soon as  
the period of mourning, which the laws of  
etiquette required, for her brother's death,  
had expired, they were united in the silken  
bands of marriage.  
  
The Duke with rapture beheld the hap-  
piness his beloved children enjoyed, and,  
through his influence with the King, the  
succession to his titles and estates, were  
settled upon Louis.  
  
The humane surgeon, of whom honour-  
able mention has been made, had only one  
surviving daughter, whose charms made an  
impression on the susceptible heart of Hen-  
ry Boileau, that was not to be effaced.  
The attachment was mutual, and much to  
the satisfaction of their friends, whose in-  
timacy would be cemented by their union.  
Large additions were made to the Chat-  
eau, and in this delightful retirement, far  
distant from the busy and tumultuous  
scenes of life, the Duke of Alencon, Mons.  
Berton, Louis (now Count de Vauban) his  
brother Henry, and the venerable Mons.  
Dupont, with their respective families,  
passed the remainder of their lives, in the  
enjoyment of a greater portion of felicity,  
than is the usual lot of mankind. No tales  
of woe, no descriptive scenes of carnage and  
bloodshed, ever disturbed their tranquillity,  
but possessing within themselves inexhaust-  
ible resources of amusement, they lived  
insulated from the rest of mankind. No  
foe to domestic tranquility, ever passed  
their threshold, no intestine uneasiness in-  
habited their retirement, but as far as pos-  
sible for humanity, they enjoyed *perma-*  
*nent and unalloyed happiness*.  
HAVING brought this story too close, it  
may not be superfluous to account for the  
author’s adding this to the multitude of si-  
milar trifles, with which the literary world  
abounds. He is confident, that attempts  
of this kind, are productive of nothing but  
amusement, and are frequently barren even  
of this. Tales, (unless moral,) novels, and  
romances are justly considered as weeds  
in the garden of literature, which prevent  
the growth of, and attract the attention  
from, more useful productions. To drive  
away the *monster ennύi*, to pass away those  
hours of leisure, which fall to the lot of  
every one, and to derive from it amusement,  
were the motives by which he was actua-  
ted. He does not pretend that it incul-  
cates any new moral, but if he may be ex-  
onerated from censure, in increasing the  
number or works of this kind, if it has con-  
duced to the amusement of any, he is satis-  
fied. Approbation he does not court, but  
to incur censure he has strove to avoid,  
and he hopes that this tale will find refuge  
in its insignificance from the penetrating  
eye of criticism. JULIUS  
  
\[JULIUS is entitled to thanks of the editor, for the  
punctuality with which he has forwarded the copy of  
the Adventures in a castle--That the literary world a-  
bounds with the trifles of this kind is true; and this, no  
doubt, in some measure, forms a criterion by which to  
judge of the taste of the age; tho’ a taste of this kind  
of reading, is not, perhaps, peculiar to the present one.  
The story under consideration inculcates a moral, if not  
new, yet good--Avarice, stimulating to treachery and a  
variety of vicious a??s, in the person of the Count de  
Vauban, meets with the deserved punishment: while the  
innocent objects of his horrid persecution, are extricated  
from his cruel fangs, and finally brought to the enjoy-  
ment of more perfect domestic felicity, than they would  
otherwise probably have attained, had it not been for  
those very circumstances to which his machinations gave  
birth--corroborating a divine truth, that the wicked are  
often snared in their own devices. The reader will  
also observe, (and it does credit to the writer,) that the  
the language is free from those passionate exclamations,  
that often insinuate a degree of profanity into the mind,  
and with which tales and novels frequently abound,  
Should Julius continue his correspondence, as he has  
hinted to the editor may be the case, he will always meet  
with merited attention.\]
